# Design Principles

## Core Philosophy

This website embodies a minimalist, modern aesthetic centered around liquid glass morphism with subtle color accents. The design prioritizes clarity, readability, and professional presentation suitable for an Engineering Leader portfolio.

## Key Principles

### 1. Minimalism
- **Clean layouts** with generous whitespace
- **Uncluttered interfaces** that focus attention on content
- **Purposeful elements** - every component serves a clear function
- **Reduced visual noise** to enhance readability

### 2. Liquid Glass Morphism
- **Polymorphic shapes** with varied border-radius values
- **Backdrop blur effects** creating depth and layering
- **Semi-transparent surfaces** that reveal subtle background elements
- **Smooth transitions** between states
- **Glass-like appearance** with subtle borders and shadows

### 3. Modern Aesthetics
- **Contemporary design patterns** aligned with current web standards
- **Smooth animations** and micro-interactions
- **Responsive design** that works across all devices
- **Accessibility-first** approach ensuring inclusive design

### 4. Color Strategy
- **Subtle reds** used sparingly for accents and highlights
- **Subtle greens** for positive indicators and success states
- **Neutral base** with dark/light theme support
- **Glass effects** that adapt to theme context

### 5. Typography Hierarchy
- **Clear information architecture** through font sizing
- **Readable fonts** optimized for screen reading
- **Consistent spacing** between elements
- **Bold headings** that establish visual hierarchy

### 6. Component Consistency
- **Reusable patterns** across the site
- **Consistent spacing** and sizing
- **Predictable interactions** that users can learn once
- **Glass morphism** applied consistently to interactive elements
