## Let's grab coffee, dinner, or do something fun together!

I'm someone who builds things for a living and a life that feels grounded, curious, and real. By day, I'm an engineering leader with a long background in fintech and product building. I enjoy solving hard problems, creating systems that actually work, and leading teams with clarity and empathy. I care a lot about doing meaningful work, but I don't define myself by my job alone.

Outside of work, I'm most at home outside. I love being in the mountains, on the water, or anywhere that requires moving my body and paying attention. Skiing, biking, hiking, wind sports, and camping are all part of my rhythm. I'm not chasing adrenaline for the sake of it. I just feel most like myself when I'm present, a little challenged, and breathing fresh air.

I'm a dad to two kids who are the center of my world. Co-parenting has shaped me in ways that made me more patient, intentional, and honest about what matters. Family time is important to me, whether that's a low-key evening, a weekend adventure, or just showing up consistently in the ways that count.

Emotionally, I'm self-aware and actively doing the work. Therapy, reflection, growth, accountability. I don't run from hard conversations, and I don't pretend I have everything figured out. I value kindness, emotional intelligence, humor, and the ability to communicate directly without cruelty. I can be playful and light, but I'm also thoughtful and sincere.

- You want something that grows slowly, with intention, laughter, and respect
- You don't need to share all my interests, but you appreciate someone who has their own

### If you're not a good fit, here are some characteristics:

- You're here for games, drama, or chaos
