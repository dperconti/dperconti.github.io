After years of working long hours and neglecting physical health, I've learned that regular exercise isn't a luxury-it's a productivity multiplier. The engineers I've worked with who maintain active lifestyles consistently outperform their sedentary peers.

#### The Science

Exercise improves:
- Cognitive function and memory
- Stress management
- Sleep quality
- Energy levels throughout the day

For engineering work that requires deep focus and problem-solving, these benefits compound.

#### My Routine

I've settled into a routine that works:
- Morning runs (3-4x per week) for mental clarity
- Strength training (2x per week) for energy
- Weekend hikes for perspective

The key is consistency, not intensity. Even 20-30 minutes makes a difference.

#### Team Culture

At Heard, we encouraged active lifestyles:
- Flexible schedules for workouts
- Step challenges and fitness goals
- Walking meetings when possible
- No judgment about taking breaks

#### The Business Case

Teams with active lifestyles show:
- Lower burnout rates
- Better problem-solving
- More sustainable productivity
- Higher job satisfaction

#### Practical Tips

1. Schedule exercise like a meeting
2. Start small-even 10 minutes helps
3. Find activities you enjoy
4. Make it social when possible
5. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good

The best code I've written came after a good run, not after pulling an all-nighter.
