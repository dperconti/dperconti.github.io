Engineering work is inherently stressful-tight deadlines, complex problems, production incidents. After years in the field, I've learned that managing stress isn't about eliminating it, but developing healthy coping mechanisms.

#### Understanding Stress

Not all stress is bad. Eustress (positive stress) can drive performance. But chronic stress leads to burnout, poor decision-making, and health problems.

#### Signs of Unhealthy Stress

- Difficulty sleeping
- Irritability and mood swings
- Physical symptoms (headaches, tension)
- Decreased productivity
- Withdrawal from social activities

#### Strategies That Work

**1. Physical Activity**
Regular exercise is the best stress reliever. Even 20 minutes of walking helps.

**2. Mindfulness Practices**
Meditation, deep breathing, or just taking breaks to reset.

**3. Time Management**
Prioritize ruthlessly. Not everything is urgent.

**4. Boundaries**
Learn to say no. Protect your time and energy.

**5. Social Support**
Talk to colleagues, friends, or a therapist.

#### At Work

- Take regular breaks (Pomodoro technique)
- Don't check email after hours
- Use your vacation time
- Ask for help when stuck
- Celebrate small wins

#### The Leadership Angle

As a leader, I've learned to:
- Model healthy behavior
- Create psychological safety
- Encourage time off
- Recognize signs of burnout
- Provide resources and support

> "You can't pour from an empty cup. Take care of yourself first."

#### When to Seek Help

If stress is impacting your daily life, relationships, or health, consider:
- Therapy or counseling
- Employee assistance programs
- Support groups
- Medical consultation

Your mental health is as important as your code quality.
