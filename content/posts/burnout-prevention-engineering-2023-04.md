Burnout is an epidemic in engineering. After seeing too many talented engineers leave the industry due to burnout, I've made it a priority to build teams and cultures that prevent it rather than just treat it.

#### What is Burnout?

Burnout isn't just being tired. It's a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress. Symptoms include:
- Exhaustion
- Cynicism and detachment
- Reduced performance
- Loss of motivation

#### Root Causes

**1. Unrealistic Expectations**
Deadlines that can't be met, scope creep, constant "urgent" requests.

**2. Lack of Control**
No say in what you work on or how you work.

**3. Insufficient Rewards**
Not feeling valued or compensated fairly.

**4. Breakdown of Community**
Isolation, conflict, lack of support.

**5. Absence of Fairness**
Favoritism, unfair policies, inconsistent treatment.

#### Prevention Strategies

**For Individuals:**
- Set boundaries (work hours, availability)
- Take regular breaks and vacations
- Maintain hobbies and relationships outside work
- Exercise regularly
- Seek help when needed

**For Leaders:**
- Model healthy behavior
- Set realistic expectations
- Provide autonomy and control
- Recognize and reward good work
- Create psychological safety
- Encourage time off
- Monitor team health

**For Organizations:**
- Reasonable work hours
- Generous time off policies
- Mental health support
- Clear career paths
- Fair compensation
- Healthy culture

#### Early Warning Signs

Watch for:
- Increased sick days
- Decreased productivity
- Negative attitude changes
- Withdrawal from team activities
- Quality issues in work

#### Intervention

If you notice burnout:
1. Have a private conversation
2. Listen without judgment
3. Offer support and resources
4. Adjust workload if possible
5. Check in regularly

#### The Business Case

Preventing burnout:
- Reduces turnover (expensive!)
- Improves productivity
- Increases innovation
- Better code quality
- Higher team morale

> "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."

Investing in burnout prevention isn't just the right thing to do-it's good business.
