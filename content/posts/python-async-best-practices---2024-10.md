After years of experience in engineering leadership and fintech, I've learned that python async best practices requires careful attention to both technical excellence and human factors.

#### The Challenge

Python async best practices is something I've encountered throughout my career at companies like Mercury, Heard, Ness, and now Pangea. The key is understanding both the technical and human aspects.

#### Key Insights

1. **Technical Excellence**: Whether it's Python, TypeScript, or infrastructure, solid technical foundations matter.

2. **People First**: Engineering is ultimately about people-building systems that serve users and teams that thrive.

3. **Balance**: Finding the right balance between technical depth and practical application.

#### Lessons Learned

- Start with understanding the problem deeply
- Build iteratively and get feedback early
- Invest in both technical skills and soft skills
- Take care of your mental and physical health

> "The best engineering solutions come from understanding both the code and the people who use it."

#### Next Steps

Consider how python async best practices applies to your own work. What can you learn? What can you improve? How can you help others?
