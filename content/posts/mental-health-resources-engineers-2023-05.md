After years in engineering leadership, I've compiled a list of mental health resources that have helped me and my teams. Mental health is just as important as code quality, and there's no shame in seeking help.

#### Professional Resources

- BetterHelp, Talkspace (online therapy)
- Local therapists (in-person)

- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
- International Association for Suicide Prevention

#### Self-Help Tools

**Apps**
- Headspace (meditation)
- Calm (sleep and meditation)
- Mood Meter (emotion tracking)
- Daylio (mood journaling)

**Books**

#### Community Support

- Peer support networks
- Online forums (with caution)

#### Workplace Resources

**What to Look For:**
- Mental health benefits
- EAP programs
- Flexible schedules
- Mental health days
- Supportive culture

**What to Ask For:**

#### Self-Care Practices

Consider professional help if you experience:

- Changes in sleep or appetite
- Difficulty concentrating

#### Breaking the Stigma

Talking about mental health normalizes it. As leaders, we can:
- Share our own experiences
- Create safe spaces for discussion
- Provide resources and support
- Model healthy behavior

> "Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness."

Your mental health matters. Don't hesitate to reach out for support.
