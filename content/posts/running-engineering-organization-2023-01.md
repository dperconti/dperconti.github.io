After managing teams at Mercury, Elevate Security, and now Heard, I've learned that running an engineering organization is less about technology and more about people, systems, and strategy.

#### The Three Pillars

**1. People**
Hiring, developing, and retaining talent. This means creating growth opportunities, providing clear feedback, and building a culture where people want to stay.

**2. Systems**
Processes that scale. From code review to incident response, systems should make good outcomes easy and bad outcomes hard.

**3. Strategy**
Knowing what to build and why. This requires deep understanding of business goals and customer needs.

#### Common Mistakes

- Optimizing for velocity over outcomes
- Building systems before understanding problems
- Neglecting developer experience
- Focusing on technology over business value

#### What Works

- Clear communication of priorities
- Empowering teams to make decisions
- Investing in developer productivity
- Measuring what matters (outcomes, not outputs)

> "Good engineering management is about creating conditions where great work can happen."

#### The Hard Truth

You can't optimize everything. Trade-offs are constant. The key is making explicit decisions about what you're optimizing for and communicating those decisions clearly.
