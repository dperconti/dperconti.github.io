I've been running for years, but it wasn't until I started tracking the correlation between my runs and coding performance that I realized how powerful the connection is. The days I run in the morning, I write better code, solve problems faster, and make fewer mistakes.

#### The Science

Running increases blood flow to the brain, releases endorphins, and reduces cortisol (the stress hormone). Studies show that regular aerobic exercise improves:
- Working memory
- Cognitive flexibility
- Problem-solving ability
- Focus and attention

#### My Routine

I run 3-4 times per week, usually in the morning before work:
- Tuesday/Thursday: 3-4 mile runs
- Saturday: Longer run (5-7 miles)
- Sunday: Recovery walk or light jog

The key is consistency, not intensity.

#### The Coding Connection

After a run, I notice:
- Better focus during deep work sessions
- More creative solutions to problems
- Improved debugging ability
- Less frustration when stuck

#### Practical Tips

**1. Start Small**
Even 10-15 minutes helps. You don't need to run marathons.

**2. Find Your Time**
Morning works for me, but find what fits your schedule.

**3. Make It Social**
Running with colleagues or friends adds accountability.

**4. Track Progress**
Use apps to see improvement over time.

**5. Don't Skip Recovery**
Rest days are important for avoiding injury.

#### The Team Impact

At Heard, we encouraged active lifestyles:
- Flexible schedules for workouts
- Step challenges
- Walking meetings
- No judgment about taking breaks

Teams with active members showed:
- Lower burnout rates
- Better collaboration
- More sustainable productivity
- Higher job satisfaction

#### The Hard Truth

It's easy to skip runs when work gets busy. But that's exactly when you need them most. Running isn't taking time away from work-it's investing in your ability to do better work.

If you're struggling with focus or problem-solving, try adding regular runs to your routine. Your code (and your health) will thank you.
