At Cloudentity, I managed an overseas team delivering solutions in Scala and React. Managing distributed teams across time zones requires different skills than managing co-located teams.

#### The Challenges

Distributed teams face:
- Time zone differences
- Cultural differences
- Communication barriers
- Lack of face-to-face interaction
- Coordination overhead

#### What Works

**1. Overlap Hours**
Establish core hours when everyone is available. We had 4 hours of overlap between US and overseas teams.

**2. Async-First Communication**
Default to async (Slack, email, docs) with sync meetings only when necessary.

**3. Clear Documentation**
Write everything down. Don't rely on verbal communication.

**4. Regular Check-ins**
Weekly 1:1s, daily standups, and regular team meetings.

**5. Cultural Awareness**
Understand and respect cultural differences in communication and work styles.

#### Communication Practices

**Daily Standups**
- Async updates in Slack
- Video standup once per week
- Focus on blockers and progress

**Documentation**
- Architecture decisions in ADRs
- API contracts in OpenAPI specs
- Runbooks for operations
- Meeting notes shared immediately

**Code Reviews**
- Clear guidelines and expectations
- Timely reviews (within 24 hours)
- Constructive feedback
- Pair programming when possible

#### Tools

- **Slack**: Daily communication
- **Zoom**: Video meetings
- **GitHub**: Code collaboration
- **Notion**: Documentation
- **Jira**: Project tracking

#### Building Trust

- Be available during overlap hours
- Respond to messages promptly
- Follow through on commitments
- Recognize good work publicly
- Address issues directly

#### Handling Conflicts

- Address issues early
- Use video calls for difficult conversations
- Focus on facts, not assumptions
- Seek to understand different perspectives
- Find win-win solutions

#### Results

- Successful project delivery
- Strong team cohesion
- Good work-life balance for all
- High code quality
- Positive team culture

#### Lessons Learned

1. Communication is everything
2. Documentation is critical
3. Trust takes time to build
4. Cultural awareness matters
5. Overlap hours are essential
